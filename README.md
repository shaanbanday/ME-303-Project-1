# ME 303 â€“ Project 1: F1 Vehicle Dynamics Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code and figures developed for **Project 1** in **ME 303: Numerical Methods for Mechanical Engineers** at the University of Waterloo. The project applies **Eulerâ€™s Method** and **Runge-Kutta Methods** to model the dynamic behavior of a Formula 1 vehicle under varying conditions.

## ðŸš˜ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to implement numerical integration techniques to solve ODEs relevant to vehicle dynamics. Specific tasks include simulating acceleration, yaw, and tire model behavior using both explicit and higher-order solvers.
